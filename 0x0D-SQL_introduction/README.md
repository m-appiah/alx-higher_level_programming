SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It's a standard language used to interact with relational databases. SQL allows users to create, manipulate, and retrieve data from databases. Its primary functions include:

Data Querying: SQL is primarily used to query data from databases. The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables based on specific criteria.

Data Manipulation: SQL provides commands to modify existing data in a database. Commands like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE are used to add, modify, or remove data from tables.

Data Definition: SQL also includes commands to define the structure and organization of the database. CREATE, ALTER, and DROP statements are used to create, modify, or delete database objects like tables, indexes, views, and procedures.

Data Control: SQL provides commands for managing access to the database. GRANT and REVOKE statements are used to grant or revoke privileges and permissions to users and roles.
