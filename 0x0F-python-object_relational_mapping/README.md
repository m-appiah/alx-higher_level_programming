Python's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique used to bridge the gap between the object-oriented programming paradigm and relational databases. It essentially allows developers to work with objects in their programming language (Python, in this case) while abstracting away the complexities of dealing directly with a database.

ORM frameworks in Python, such as SQLAlchemy and Django's ORM, provide a way to represent database tables as classes and their relationships as object attributes. This enables developers to interact with the database using familiar object-oriented techniques like inheritance, encapsulation, and association.

By using ORM, developers can perform database operations (like querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data) using high-level programming constructs rather than writing raw SQL queries. This simplifies the code, makes it more maintainable, and allows for better portability across different database systems without requiring significant changes in the codebase.

Overall, Python's Object-Relational Mapping provides a powerful abstraction layer that facilitates working with databases in an object-oriented manner, making development more efficient and code more readable.
